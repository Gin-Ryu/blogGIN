            Hello! my name is Gauri Negi.This is my first ever website. The webpage isn't quite how I wanted it to be and also how gdsc wanted it to be. It doesn't have a sign in/up option, a post creation page, no use of local storage because I couldn't do js. This site is purely based on html and css.

                <p>Have you ever sat down with an idea so vivid in your head that you were convinced it would be brilliant once you brought it to life—only to find that the end result looked nothing like what you imagined? That frustrating gap between what’s in your mind and what shows up on paper, canvas, or screen is what many people call the creative gap. And honestly, it can make us feel “creatively challenged.”

                But here’s the truth: creativity isn’t just about drawing masterpieces, writing bestselling novels, or composing music that makes people cry. At its core, creativity is about problem-solving and seeing the world in ways that others might miss. Rearranging your desk to make it more functional? That’s creativity. Coming up with a new way to explain a tough concept? Creativity. Even experimenting with a recipe in the kitchen counts. Creativity lives in the small, everyday moments just as much as in the grand works of art.

                So why do so many of us feel stuck or blocked? A big reason is self-doubt. We often compare ourselves to professionals who have been practicing their craft for years, forgetting that what we’re seeing is the polished result, not the messy process behind it. Another reason is the fear of judgment. Sometimes, we don’t even start because we worry about what people will think. And then there’s the pressure of originality—the belief that if something isn’t groundbreaking, it isn’t worth doing. These mental roadblocks can be heavy, but they don’t mean we aren’t creative; they just mean we’re human.

                Here’s the good news: creativity works like a muscle. The more you use it, the stronger it gets. If you go to the gym for the first time, you don’t expect to lift the heaviest weight immediately. You start small, build consistency, and gradually grow stronger. It’s the same with creativity. Every little sketch, idea, doodle, or experiment is like a rep in your creative workout. You may not love all your attempts, but each one is building skill and confidence.

                Being “creatively challenged” isn’t a permanent label. It simply means your imagination might be running faster than your current ability to express it. And that’s perfectly normal. In fact, it’s a sign that your mind is working, dreaming, and pushing you forward. The gap between imagination and execution isn’t a failure—it’s an invitation. It’s a reminder to keep practicing, keep exploring, and keep allowing yourself the freedom to fail without shame.

                I’ve started looking at creativity less as a test of talent and more as an adventure. Some days, the things I make feel messy or incomplete, but that’s okay. That’s part of the journey. The point isn’t to be perfect; the point is to keep trying, keep experimenting, and keep bridging that gap between the ideas in your head and the things you bring into the world.

                So, are you creatively challenged? Maybe. But maybe that’s not such a bad thing. Because in those challenges, you’ll find growth, play, and the kind of discoveries that only happen when you’re brave enough to begin. 🌟</p>
