            Hello! my name is Gauri Negi.This is my first ever website. The webpage isn't quite how I wanted it to be and also how gdsc wanted it to be. It doesn't have a sign in/up option, a post creation page (it doesn't work locally, it's just there for show), no use of local storage because I couldn't do js. This site is purely based on html and css. But I'm content that atleast I tried.

                <p>We live in a time where every second is accounted for. If you’re not studying, you’re working. If you’re not working, you’re scrolling. Even our rest has to be “productive”—yoga, meditation, journaling, self-care rituals. The silence between things has been erased, replaced by a constant hum of activity. And yet, if you look at where real creativity often sparks, it’s in those unguarded, idle spaces—the ones we label as “doing nothing.”

                Think about it. The shower thought that suddenly connects two ideas. The bus ride where your mind wanders into a story. The lazy afternoon where doodles on scrap paper turn into something you didn’t know you wanted to make. These moments don’t come from grinding harder or stuffing more content into your brain. They come when your mind has room to play.

                But we’re afraid of that room. We’re afraid of boredom, of blank space. Somewhere along the way, doing nothing got confused with being lazy, with being unworthy. We punish ourselves for sitting still, as if we owe the world constant proof that we’re useful. Creativity doesn’t thrive in that environment—it suffocates. It needs air. It needs silence. It needs boredom.

                Some of the world’s greatest minds have known this. Einstein famously claimed that his best ideas came during long walks. Artists retreat into solitude not because they’re avoiding life, but because they’re listening for something beneath the noise. Writers stare out windows for hours, not because they’re procrastinating, but because their brain is busy rearranging the puzzle pieces in the background.

                What if instead of treating boredom as a weakness, we treated it as an invitation? The next time you catch yourself reaching for your phone because you have “nothing to do,” stop. Sit with the nothing. Stare at the ceiling. Watch the clouds move. Count how many cracks your wall has. Let your thoughts wander aimlessly. At first, it feels uncomfortable, like you’ve been dropped into a void. But wait a little longer, and you’ll notice your mind doing what it does best: creating.

                The irony is that doing nothing is not really “nothing.” It’s mental composting. All the little scraps of information, conversations, feelings, and half-formed thoughts get broken down and recombined into new growth. If you never pause, you never give that compost time to work.

                So here’s a bold thought: maybe the most radical act in our hyper-productive world is to sit still and let your brain breathe. To honor boredom instead of erasing it. To see “nothing” not as a gap in life, but as the space where life brews its most original ideas.

                The next time guilt whispers that you’re wasting time, remember: idleness is not absence. It is incubation. And maybe, just maybe, the best thing you can do for your creativity today is nothing at all.</p>
